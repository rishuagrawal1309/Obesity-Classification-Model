This project develops a multi-class obesity classification model using demographic and lifestyle features.
The goal is to predict an individual's obesity category (e.g., Normal Weight, Overweight, Obesity Type I–III) based on their health and activity data.

A LightGBM model optimized with Optuna’s TPE algorithm achieved high accuracy and balanced performance across all classes.
